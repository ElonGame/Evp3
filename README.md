**Evp3** is a Unity project that was used in the demonstration at Unite
Shanghai 2019. The demonstration was presented in the beginning of [my talk]
with a Chinese traditional instrument ([pipa]) player. In the demonstration, a
[RealSense] depth camera was used to capture the appearance and the motion of
the player. It's visualized using [Visual Effect Graph] in the same manner as
[Rsvfx].

Evp3 was made with Unity 2019.1. A RealSense depth camera device (D415 is
preferred) and an audio input device (mic) are required.
